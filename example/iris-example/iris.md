# Iris flower data set

From the [Wikipedia *Iris flower data set* page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set):

> The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (*Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor*). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.
>
> Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".
